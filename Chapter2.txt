... get in the car!
 No time to explain!"
"Just a minute," I cried,
"Can't you see all that rain?"

He straightened his hat,
with an audible sigh,
and said "If you stay here,
you're going to die."

Sally stood up and said
"I'll grab the fish."
I paused for a moment,
thinking, oh how I wish

that this cat would explain
just why he was here,
'cause I'm not sure his motives
were entirely clear.

But despite how I felt
a few minutes passed,
and we were bracing ourselves
as he stepped on the gas.
